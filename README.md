## Task 
Antin and Ori came up with a game - to invent random binary numbers, 
and check whether these numbers can be divided into pieces, each of
which is the power of the number X in the decimal system.

For example, if X == 5, then the binary number 
101110011 can be divided into 101, 11001 and 1, 
each of which is 5 to some degree 
(101 in decimal == 5 == 5 ^ 1, 11001 == 25 == 5 ^ 2 and 1 == 1 is 5 ^ 0).

for a given binary number N, find the smallest number of pieces into which it should be divided.
```
In:
  101101101 5
Out:
  (can be parsed on [101, 101, 101])
